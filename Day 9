Table name: events

  event_id	event_name

Hard

My Answer:

    WITH Dish_calorie_density AS (   
        SELECT
        menu.dish_name,
        events.event_name,
        (calories/weight_g) AS calorie_density,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY menu.event_id
            ORDER BY (calories/weight_g) DESC
        ) AS Rank
        FROM events
        INNER JOIN menu 
        ON events.event_id = menu.event_id
        )
    SELECT 
        dish_name,
        event_name,
        calorie_density
    FROM Dish_calorie_density
    WHERE Rank <4
    ORDER BY event_name, RANK;

Query Results:

  dish_name	event_name	calorie_density
  Chocolate Yule Log	Christmas Eve Dinner	2
  Roast Turkey	Christmas Eve Dinner	0
  Cheese Fondue	New Years Feast	1
  Honey Glazed Ham	New Years Feast	0
