Today's Question:

Santa needs to optimize his sleigh for Christmas deliveries. Write a query to calculate the total weight of gifts for each recipient type (good or naughty) and determine what percentage of the total weight is allocated to each type. Include the recipient_type, total_weight, and weight_percentage in the result.

Table name: gifts

  gift_id	gift_name	recipient_type	weight_kg
  1	Toy Train	good	2.5
  2	Lumps of Coal	naughty	1.5
  3	Teddy Bear	good	1.2
  4	Chocolate Bar	good	0.3
  5	Board Game	naughty	1.8

Question level of difficulty: Hard

My Answer using subquery without CTEs:

  SELECT
    recipient_type,
    SUM(weight_kg) AS total_weight,
    (SUM(weight_kg * 100) / (SELECT (SUM(weight_kg)) FROM gifts)) AS weight_percentage
  FROM gifts
  GROUP BY recipient_type
  ORDER BY weight_percentage;

Results:

  recipient_type	total_weight	weight_percentage
  naughty	3.3	45.205479452054796
  good	4	54.794520547945204

Correct!! ðŸŽ‰ Great work!

My Answer using CTE's for readability, scalability, and reusability:

  WITH total_weights AS (
        SELECT
            recipient_type,
            SUM(weight_kg) AS total_weight
            FROM gifts
            GROUP BY recipient_type
        ),
    grand_total AS (
        SELECT
            SUM(total_weight) AS grand_total_weight
        FROM total_weights
        )
SELECT
    tw.recipient_type,
    tw.total_weight,
    ROUND((tw.total_weight * 100 / gt.grand_total_weight),1) AS weight_percentage
FROM total_weights AS tw
CROSS JOIN grand_total AS gt 
ORDER BY weight_percentage;

Results:

  recipient_type	total_weight	weight_percentage
  naughty	3.3	45.2
  good	4	54.8

Correct!! ðŸŽ‰ Great work!
