Today's Question:

Scientists are studying the diets of polar bears. Write a query to find the maximum amount of food (in kilograms) consumed by each polar bear in a single meal December 2024. Include the bear_name and biggest_meal_kg, and sort the results in descending order of largest meal consumed.

Table name: polar_bears

  bear_id	bear_name	age
  1	Snowball	10
  2	Frosty	7
  3	Iceberg	15

Table name: meal_log

  log_id	bear_id	food_type	food_weight_kg	date
  1	1	Seal	30	2024-12-01
  2	2	Fish	15	2024-12-02
  3	1	Fish	10	2024-12-03
  4	3	Seal	25	2024-12-04
  5	2	Seal	20	2024-12-05
  6	3	Fish	18	2024-12-06

Question level of difficulty: Medium

My Answer:

    WITH biggest_meal AS (
      SELECT
          pb.bear_name,
          MAX(log.food_weight_kg) AS biggest_meal_kg
      FROM polar_bears AS pb
      INNER JOIN meal_log AS log 
      ON pb.bear_id = log.bear_id 
      WHERE log.date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' AND '2024-12-31'
      GROUP BY pb.bear_name
  )
  SELECT
      bear_name,
      biggest_meal_kg
  FROM biggest_meal
  ORDER BY biggest_meal_kg DESC;

Results:

  bear_name	biggest_meal_kg
  Snowball	30
  Iceberg	25
  Frosty	20

Correct!! ðŸŽ‰ Great work!
