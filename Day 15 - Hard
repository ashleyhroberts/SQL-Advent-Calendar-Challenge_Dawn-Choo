Today's Question:

A family reunion is being planned, and the organizer wants to identify the three family members with the most children. Write a query to calculate the total number of children for each parent and rank them. Include the parentâ€™s name and their total number of children in the result.

Table name: family_members

  member_id	name	age
  1	Alice	30
  2	Bob	58
  3	Charlie	33
  4	Diana	55
  5	Eve	5
  6	Frank	60
  7	Grace	32
  8	Hannah	8
  9	Ian	12
  10	Jack	3

Table name: parent_child_relationships

  parent_id	child_id
  2	1
  3	5
  4	1
  6	7
  6	8
  7	9
  7	10
  4	8

Question level of difficulty: Hard

My Answer (without CTE or Window function):

  SELECT
    name,
    COUNT(child_id) AS num_kids
  FROM family_members AS fm 
  INNER JOIN parent_child_relationships AS pcr 
      ON fm.member_id = pcr.parent_id 
  GROUP BY name
  ORDER BY num_kids DESC
  LIMIT 3;

Results:

  name	num_kids
  Grace	2
  Frank	2
  Diana	2

Correct!! ðŸŽ‰ Great work!

My Answer using Dense Rank with CTE and Window Function:

  WITH KidCount AS (
    SELECT
        fm.name,
        COUNT(pcr.child_id) AS num_kids
    FROM family_members AS fm 
    INNER JOIN parent_child_relationships AS pcr 
        ON fm.member_id = pcr.parent_id 
    GROUP BY fm.name
  ),
  RankedParents AS (
      SELECT      
          name,
          num_kids,
          DENSE_RANK() OVER
              (ORDER BY num_kids DESC) AS Rank
      FROM KidCount
  )
  SELECT
      name,
      num_kids,
      Rank 
  FROM RankedParents
  WHERE Rank <=3
  ORDER BY Rank;

Results:

  name	num_kids	Rank
  Diana	2	1
  Frank	2	1
  Grace	2	1
  Bob	1	2
  Charlie	1	2

Correct!! ðŸŽ‰ Great work!
