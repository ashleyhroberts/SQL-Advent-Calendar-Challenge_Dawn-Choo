Today's Question:

You are tracking your friends' New Yearâ€™s resolution progress. Write a query to calculate the following for each friend: number of resolutions they made, number of resolutions they completed, and success percentage (% of resolutions completed) and a success category based on the success percentage:
- Green: If success percentage is greater than 75%.
- Yellow: If success percentage is between 50% and 75% (inclusive).
- Red: If success percentage is less than 50%.

Table name: resolutions

  resolution_id	  friend_name	  resolution	is_completed
  1	Alice	Exercise daily	1
  2	Alice	Read 20 books	0
  3	Bob	Save money	0
  4	Bob	Eat healthier	1
  5	Charlie	Travel more	1

Question level of difficulty: Medium

My Answer:

  SELECT
      friend_name,
      COUNT(resolution) AS num_resolutions_made,
      SUM(is_completed) AS num_resolutions_kept,
      (SUM(is_completed) / COUNT(resolution) *100) AS success_percentage,
      CASE
          WHEN (SUM(is_completed) / COUNT(resolution) *100) >75 THEN 'Green'
          WHEN (SUM(is_completed) / COUNT(resolution) *100) BETWEEN 50 AND 75 THEN 'Yellow'
          WHEN (SUM(is_completed) / COUNT(resolution) *100) <50 THEN 'Red'
          END AS success_category
  FROM resolutions
  GROUP BY friend_name;

Results:

  friend_name	num_resolutions_made	num_resolutions_kept	success_percentage	success_category
  Alice	2	1	0	Red
  Bob	2	1	0	Red
  Charlie	2	2	100	Green
  Diana	3	2	0	Red

Correct!! ðŸŽ‰ Great work!
